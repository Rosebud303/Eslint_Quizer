Spacing much like Identation helps you create more readable code. Spacing after declaration of a key word or function allows the compiler to understand what kind of code you are writing. It can also determine if a piece of code you wrote works as well.",

Coders make the mistake of creating variables and never using them all the time. This is a practice that should be erased from memory ASAP. When you forget to use or even just forget that a variable is there it makes your code look very sloppy and unprofessional. It can also make your code hard to understand and follow.",
